## What is VeraCrypt?

**VeraCrypt** is a powerful, free, and open-source disk encryption software widely recognized as the successor to TrueCrypt. It adds enhanced security to the algorithms used for system and partition encryption, making it resistant to new developments in brute-force attacks. VeraCrypt creates a virtual encrypted disk within a file and mounts it as a real disk, encrypting an entire partition or storage device such as a USB flash drive or hard drive.

With VeraCrypt, users can benefit from:
- **On-the-fly encryption** – Data is automatically encrypted right before it is saved and decrypted right after it is loaded, without any user intervention.
- **Plausible deniability** – Hidden volumes and hidden operating systems provide protection against forced decryption.
- **Strong encryption algorithms** – Utilizes AES, Serpent, and Twofish algorithms individually or in cascade.
- **Cross-platform compatibility** – Available for Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.

VeraCrypt is trusted by security professionals, journalists, and privacy-conscious individuals worldwide for securing sensitive data against unauthorized access. Whether you need to protect your business documents, personal files, or entire operating system, VeraCrypt provides a reliable and auditable solution.
